This is used to generate a dataset of conformers by running either ML-Potential MD of Force-Field MD and grabbing a number of snapshots. For every snapshot, the energies and forces are taken using the ML-Potental.</p> <p>This dataset is used to minimize the given force field parameters using the ADAM stochastic optimization method, where the loss function is the squared difference between energies and forces for the conformer dataset predicted by the force-field parametrization and the stored values calculated with the ML-potential.</p> <p>After a given number of epochs, the new parametrization is stored. The new force-field is used to generate another set of MD snapshots, which are used in the same way to further optimize the force field. This continues for a given number of iterations, where the relative reduction is error is tracked. The number of iterations should be increased up to convergence.</p> <p>Four methods for generating the initial dataset are implemented:</p> <p>1 - \"DATA\" : Read the dataset from a file</p> <p>2 - \"MLMD\" : Run the ML-Potential MD to get the snapshots. This is the most expensive option.</p> <p>3 - \"MMMD\" : Run Force-Field MD using the initial guess to generate the snapshots. Then use the ML-Potential to generate energies and forces</p> <p>4 - \"cMMMD\" : Run Force-Field MD using the initial guess to generate the snapshots. Cluster the snapshots with respect to their pairwise RMSD and then use the ML-Potential to generate energies and forces</p> <p>The functional form of the force-field is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Bonds and angles are defined by a harmonic function, \\(u(x;k,x_0)=\\frac{k}{2}\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2\\), where the position of the minimum, \\(x_0\\), and the magnitude, \\(k\\), are the fitting parameters.</li> <li>Proper and improper torsions are defined by a set of cosine functions, \\(u_p(\\phi;k,\\phi_0)=k\\left(1+\\cos{\\left(p\\phi-\\phi_0\\right)}\\right)\\), where the phase, \\(\\phi_0\\), and the magnitude, \\(k\\), are the fitted parameters. Here, proper torsions are expanded to include four periodicities, whereas improper torsions include only one. It is also noted that for symmetry, the phase \\(\\phi_0\\) is expected to be either 0 or \\(\\pi\\)</li> </ul> <p>To stabilize and speed up convergence of the parameter fitting, these potentials are linearized.</p> <p>The linearization of the harmonic terms followed the approach by espaloma, where the minimum is assumed to be within a window given by \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), such that the fitting parameters may by remapped onto linear terms,</p> \\[k_1=k\\frac{x_2-x_0}{x_2-x_1} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k_2=k\\frac{x_0-x_1}{x_2-x_1}\\] <p>These terms give the original parameters via,</p> \\[k=k_1+k_2 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad x_0=\\frac{k_1x_1+k_2x_2}{k_1+k_2}\\] <p>Crucially, the gradient along \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) behaves more reliably and so the parameters minimize faster.</p> <p>In a similar way, the cosine functions are linearized by defining a phase window of 0 to \\(\\pi\\), such that the parameters may be mapped onto,</p> \\[k_0=\\frac{k}{2}\\left(1+\\cos{\\phi_0}\\right) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k_{\\pi}=\\frac{k}{2}\\left(1-\\cos{\\phi_0}\\right)\\] <p>which yield the original parameters via,</p> \\[k=k_0+k_{\\pi} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\cos{\\phi_0}=\\frac{k_0-k_{\\pi}}{k_0+k_{\\pi}}\\] <p>Again, the gradient along \\(k_0\\) and \\(k_{\\pi}\\) is more reliable and the parametrization proceed faster.</p>"}]}
